My name is Alex. I am currently pursuing a second Bachelors in Software Development and Security from University of Maryland University College ‘17. My first Bachelors was in Political Science and Economics from Christopher Newport University ‘14. 

Shortly after graduating from Christopher Newport, my love for technology emerged while I visited my home country Uganda the summer of 2015. After conducting research analysis of how industries today are being disrupted by innovative tools - I was hooked! 

I enjoy solving problems, writing about technology, and sharing insightful thoughts with the world. 

Publishing articles on this blog is my way of archiving important thoughts.
