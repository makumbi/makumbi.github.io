Welcome! My name is Alex Makumbi and I am currently pursuing a second degree in Software Development and Security at University of Maryland University College expected to graduate December 2017.

In 2014, I graduated from Christopher Newport University with a B.A in Political Science and Economics with an intention of working alongside economic development professionals in Africa, specifically, in Uganda, my country of origin. 

The summer after I graduated from CNU, I took a trip to Uganda where I saw firsthand how technology was being used to solve problems in healthcare, ecommerce, and telecommunications etc., however I noticed cyber security was not being prioritized by a large percent of small businesses. Seeing this gap, I promptly decided to alter my career course which lead me to where I am today.

What has been an eye opener for me during my studies has been discovering how my political science and economics background lends itself well in the cyber security industry specifically in regards to the many day to day security operations of securing an organizationâ€™s enterprise IT systems. These activities include researching and tracking information about current security threats and potential vulnerabilities, planning and execution of Threat and Risk Assessments of enterprise IT systems and providing recommendations on how to mitigate risks, documenting and updating elements of IT security governance (e.g. policies, procedures, standards) amongst other activities.

I enjoy solving problems, writing about cybersecurity and technology, but importantly, sharing insightful thoughts with the world. 

Publishing articles on this blog is my way of archiving important thoughts.
