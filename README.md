Welcome! My name is Alex Makumbi and I am a Secure Software/Application Security professional currently holding CompTIA Security+ and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certifications. I enjoy solving problems, writing about cybersecurity and technology, but importantly, sharing insightful thoughts with the world.

Publishing articles on this blog is my way of archiving important thoughts.
