My name is Alex. I am currently pursuing a second Bachelors in Software Development and Security from University of Maryland University College ‘17. My first Bachelors was in Political Science and Economics from Christopher Newport University ‘14. Shortly after graduating from Christopher Newport, my love for technology emerged while I visited my home country Uganda the summer of 2015, and after conducting research analysis of how industries today are being disrupted by innovative tools. I enjoy solving problems and writing about technology. Publishing articles on this blog is my way of archiving important thoughts.
