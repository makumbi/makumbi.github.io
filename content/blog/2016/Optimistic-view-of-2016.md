At this time each year I take a moment to reflect on the year that was. The year 2015 began with me
knowing that I was embarking on the next phase in my life given that I had just graduated from college
in December 2014. I had somewhat of an idea how the year would turn out; for example I had secured
an internship with MenEngage so I knew I’ll be working in D.C but didn’t quite know how it would pan-
out, I wasn’t totally jumping for joy about the opportunity simply glad that I wouldn’t be home searching
for jobs. Also I knew that I would be visiting Africa for a period of time and that it would be the first time
visiting the continent in roughly 13 years. My visit to Africa was what I looked forward to the most
starting the year because I somehow knew it would change the course of my life (my thinking) and
indeed my life was forever changed. This brought with it a lot of turbulence both mentally and
professionally. The trip allowed me to rethink how I thought about careers, allowed me to look deep
inside myself to determine truly what I wanted to do with my life - understanding what path in life
would help me reach my burning desires. So as you can imagine, there was a lot uncertainty and
confusion during this time. I beat myself up inside for not foreseeing and actually valuing my education before 
getting to this point, and I vow to never take life and opportunities for granted.

The New Year has approached in quick fashion brining with it an abundance of optimism. There is no
doubt that 2016 is going to be special. Special in terms of not only will it be my second year in the real
world, but this year I’ll consume more information that I have consumed last year and the year before.
For starters, I’ll continue with course work at UMUC, in fact, in total I’ll be taking 7 courses in Software
Development and Security. On top of that, during the summer I’ll aim to secure an internship to
supplement my education and gain real work experience and make connections in the software field.

Secondly, in 2016, I’ll continue assisting Mr. Augustine Guma with is Start-Up Gumax International. This
year Gumax International is expended to open a brand new restaurant in Woodbridge called Gumax
Spicy Pies which is projected to generate a lot of revenue for the company. Before 2015 ended
customers were placing in orders for the products so all these positive signs imply that the restaurant
will be welcomingly busy. Another thing to look forward to is that Gumax International was picked as
one of the vendors at the Super Bowl in San Francisco this coming February. I hope Guma picks me to
attend such a massive event. Lastly, I’ll experience first hand how it’s like to work as a staff accountant
during tax season. During this period my accountancy skills will truly be enhance expanding my brain
farther.

I cannot write a first blog without mentioning the people in my life that make my life happen and
enjoyable. There is one thing that I’ve learned in this world no one no matter how successful someone is
no one goes through life by themselves. Each year as life happens people enter and leave your life -
some enhance your life making you a better person emotionally, professionally or economically, and
some enter your life to only pull you back. On August 16 th 2015, I was able to have the girl of my dreams
enter my life. She not only makes my heart sing sounds of joy each time I see her, but she stimulates my
brain and my thinking each time we talk. I look forward sharing my journey with her this year. My family
also plays a massive role; they are always supportive, always patent with me and are always looking out
for my best interest even when I cannot see it at the time. I love all of them and cannot wait to make
them proud some day.
