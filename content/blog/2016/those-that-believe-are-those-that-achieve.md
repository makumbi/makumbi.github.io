I’ll dub this week the carm before the storm. My two professors reached out to all of us (UMUC Students) 
reminding that our class starts next week Monday and that we should familiarize ourselves with online 
environment. Unlike last semester, this semester I decided to enroll in two classes at the same time in order 
to accelerate my education. Deep down I know I can take both courses, work at Gumax International part-time, 
volunteer with WeDev Club primarily on the weekends and manage to get good grades. I also know deep down that 
this period will take a lot out of me; this period will require an absolute attention to detail in terms of how 
I use my time during the day - how I allocate assignments to prioritize urgent work to best utilize time. 
I am envisioning many sleepless nights and long days that will require a high level of commitment. T
his can be done, it has been done, people have battled through far more challenging roads that I really have 
no excuse whatsoever. What will keep me going will be my girl friend as she’ll also be battling her own battles, 
my younger brother who has a gigantic task of work studying at UPenn and the support and love from my mom and older 
brother.
