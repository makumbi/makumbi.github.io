Today Terah was dropped off at Dulles Airport to catch his flight heading to Orlando, Florida. As you know, 
Terah spent the holidays with us. It was a welcomed stay, both for us and for him. For us it was nice to have 
someone close to our family living in the US spending the holidays with us. For him, it must have been great to 
get away from everything, school, work and the pressure of getting his life back on track to come and spend 
time with us and see that there are other Ugandans in the US who have been through the road his embarking on. 
He has a ridiculously long road ahead of him. He has so many dreams and aspirations. I’m afraid his expectations 
are almost impossible given his circumstances today.

The U.S. is not an easy place to make it, the country is embedded with so many obstacles designed to slow anyone down. 
From house expenses, car expenses, school loans etc. these are merely the few among the many roadblocks in place that 
he’ll learn to deal with. Obviously anyone with smarts, vision, dream, discipline, world class desire and work ethic 
can make it anywhere including US. My main concern is that he is following his passion for music, which is admirable 
but the music industry is notorious for its uncertainty in terms of striking it big, middle wages and low job outlook.
To me this implies that after school he's going to go through a laborious period trying to locate an entry level job. 

An attractive approach he could have taken would have been acquiring a hard skill or an in demand skill. This insures 
that he not only has an easy road to employment after school, but will command an above salary sooner. These skills will 
also be marketable in Uganda, the country he hopes to one day go back to and conduct his music aspirations. My hope is 
that he left Northern Virginia with inspiration and hope that he too can make it in the US like many people before him. 
I don’t think it has quite sank in the amount of work it is going to take to achieve his dreams. He needs to take each 
opportunity like it’s his last, not let his passion blind side him. 

Passion can only take you so far, if a person doesn’t have the aptitude to make tough decisions, decisions that go against 
his or her beliefs and everything they have known their entire life (beliefs, ideologies, values etc), career (choosing 
another path/ making a one eighty) that person does not have what it takes to be great!! In his situation, Terah has to be a 
shark, ruthless and merciless, and last but not least have a world class work ethic!!
