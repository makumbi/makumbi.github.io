The only fitting description for today would be roller-coaster of emotions. The day began in unexpected
fashion. I woke up bright and early at around 830 just in time for the Chelsea verse Cristal Palace.
Embarking on a new day my mind was empty free of any outside problems, the only objective at the
time was to brash my teeth, walk downstairs to the sitting room and connect my laptop to the television
and live stream the game. Feeling a bit hungry walked into the kitchen finding mom cleaning the dishes.
Politely greeted her and acquired on if she had good sleep. To my surprise, she was in a terrible mood
(as though the whole night she had been playing with random thoughts, juggling trying to make out all
of them at once only to foggy up her mind at a point when she cannot remember why she was feeling
the way she was or why she was trying to understand).

She was clearly not happy with me because in her mind I was extremely rude and not helpful in the
vehicle search the day before. It all began yesterday during the day. Around noon she forwarded on my
email a list of about 6 – 7 vehicles she had found on craigslist. Obviously in a different state of mind I
lethargically quickly glanced at the list of vehicles and found that the majority of vehicles were above
our budget so I dismissed the whole list entirely since in reality to me it didn’t matter. And since
Woodbridge Auto Action had our deposit of $300, I thought it would be in our best interest to look at
vehicles there so we do not lose our money. After doing a quick search I came across 4 vehicles in great
condition and in our budget so I showed her pictures along with there basic specs (mileage, condition
etc.). To my surprise she loved the vehicles and even proposed that we head over to the dealership that
evening since it was slow day and it would be nice get this car search over with before everyone gets
busy.

At the dealership, after looking at several cars we landed on a 2010 Hyundai Sonata. The vehicle was in
great condition partly because the car was only 5 years old. The engine was very quite which apparently
implies the vehicle should be able to run for another 30,000 miles. With that said, the car had extremely
high millage, 88,000 miles more than our cut off mileage conflicting with one of mom’s top conditions.
Her conditions were that we stay away from cars that have more than 150k miles, stay away from two
doors, stay away from cars not made in Asia and obviously stay away from poorly maintained cars
including cars that smelled like cigarettes. We loved the car so much that we ended up placing a deposit
of 3k and we also managed to transfer our initial deposit of $300 on the 2010 Hyundai Sonata.

As you can see I was extremely surprised to wake up in the morning to find mom in the kitchen very
angry with me. Her reason was that I did not care about the list of vehicles she had sent me on the
email. Yes, I felt sorry for not paying much attention to the list, but to my defense she sent me mixed
signals. She shouldn’t have sent me cars priced above our budget. Including cars priced above the
budget gave the notion that each car on the list was above the budge when in reality she had imbedded
cars below the budget that she really wanted me to look at. I understand that I should have taken the
email seriously, but with the same token she should take some of the responsibility. For one, if you want
me to look at two cars, don’t send me 5 other cars priced above the budget. Two, you placed a deposit
on the Hyundai knowingly that we would be short 1k, so you shouldn’t pin the blame on me because
ultimately you had the final say in the matter and that you should have used good judgment.

Luckily I managed to catch the second half of the Chelsea game. Willian had an amazing game,
absolutely brilliant constantly making things happen whenever he had the ball and scoring the second
goal securing the win. Total score (3-0) Chelsea. Sadly that was the only highlight of my Sunday. My
mind was clouded from my discussion with mom, I just couldn’t understand, my intentions were good,
yes I was a bit lazy one point or another during the process but I didn’t think it was fair to pin the blame
squarely on me. We did not make a mistake because we all agree the car is great, however she’s
thinking on what ifs; what ifs meaning we could have gotten a cheaper car.

During the day I took time to surf the web for cheap apartments and garages that would take our vehicle
for a good price. Made a call and briefly talked to Herbert to get advice on how to go about scrapping
the car. He really didn’t give me information that I already didn’t know but it was nice talking to him it
had been a while. Afterwards I sluggishly went upstairs and read a Time Magazine on Steve Jobs. I was
there for the reminder of the day and didn’t come down until the sun was down.
