<p>My name is Alex. I am currently pursuing a second Bachelors in Software Development and Security from 
    University of Maryland University College ‘17. My first Bachelors was in Political Science and Economics 
    from Christopher Newport University ‘14.</p>    
<p>Shortly after graduating from Christopher Newport, my love for 
    technology emerged while I visited my home country Uganda the summer of 2015, and after conducting research 
    analysis of how industries today are being disrupted by innovative tools. I enjoy solving problems, writing about 
    technology, and sharing insightful thoughts with the world.</p> 
<p>Publishing articles on this blog is my way of archiving important thoughts.
