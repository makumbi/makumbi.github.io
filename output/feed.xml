	&lt;p&gt;In this article I create a simple form to demonstrate insecure interaction between a java based component&lt;br/&gt;and the outside world explaining why the form poses as a vulnerability to the overall application.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, I show how to properly secure the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple Java application is created with a simple login form that retrieves username and password using&lt;br/&gt;two JTextFields and storing them into the Derby Database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import java.sql.*;

public class JavaAppInsecureSQL implements ActionListener {

                    // shutdown database connections

    {
        try

            stmt.execute(&amp;quot;insert into &amp;quot; + tableName + &amp;quot; values (&amp;#39;&amp;quot; +
                    userName + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&amp;quot; + userPass + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;);
            
            stmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)

            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    
   
    private static void shutdown()
    {
        try
        {
            if (stmt != null)
            {
                stmt.close();
            }
            if (conn != null)
            {
                DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL + &amp;quot;;shutdown=true&amp;quot;);
                conn.close();
            }           
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.getStackTrace();
        }

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once login button is pressed, the username and password is sent to be stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The simple login application does not take into account other software vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;We’re only demonstrating SQL Injection vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application works great, but when we take a look under the hood we find that this application is vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;to SQL Injection attacks because SQL statements are not prepared and are dynamically storing data directly into&lt;br/&gt;the database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insecure Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        {
            createConnection();
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute(&amp;quot;insert into &amp;quot; + tableName + &amp;quot; values (&amp;#39;&amp;quot; +
                    userName + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&amp;quot; + userPass + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;);
            
            stmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL Injection attacks are the most prevent attacks to an application and inflicts the most damage exposing&lt;br/&gt;sensitive data. Injection attacks attempt to break into application databases by injecting malicious code,&lt;br/&gt;oftentimes in a form of SQL statements. They are often injected through form fields similar to the small&lt;br/&gt;application I created, but are also injected through uploads, 3rd party APIs, configuration files, input files etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secured Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code snippet above shows the application retrieving username and password directly placing it into the SQL&lt;br/&gt;statement without validating or sanitizing the data. Essentially, the developer trusts the user not to&lt;br/&gt;inject malicious code. The user should never be trusted. Below I demonstrate how to properly prepare SQL statements&lt;br/&gt;in java. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        { 
            // establish connection
            createConnection();
            String qTxt = &amp;quot;INSERT INTO &amp;quot; + tableName + &amp;quot;VALUES (?,?)&amp;quot;;
            prepStmt = conn.prepareStatement(qTxt);
            prepStmt.setString(1, userName);
            prepStmt.setString(1, userPass);
            
            prepStmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When SQL statements are prepared information received from the user is placed in a prepared statement and not directly&lt;br/&gt;into the SQL query, thus mitigating dynamic queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this demonstration, I have alluded to mention another measure to take in order to mitigate SQL Injection attacks,&lt;br/&gt;which is to validate and sanitize data retrieved from the user. As we’ve mentioned, the application cannot trust data&lt;br/&gt;from the outside world. Information must be validated for content, length, format, and other factors before use. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I’ll dub this week the carm before the storm. My two professors reached out to all of us (UMUC Students)&lt;br/&gt;reminding that our class starts next week Monday and that we should familiarize ourselves with online&lt;br/&gt;environment. Unlike last semester, this semester I decided to enroll in two classes at the same time in order&lt;br/&gt;to accelerate my education. Deep down I know I can take both courses, work at Gumax International part-time,&lt;br/&gt;volunteer with WeDev Club primarily on the weekends and manage to get good grades. I also know deep down that&lt;br/&gt;this period will take a lot out of me; this period will require an absolute attention to detail in terms of how&lt;br/&gt;I use my time during the day - how I allocate assignments to prioritize urgent work to best utilize time.&lt;br/&gt;I am envisioning many sleepless nights and long days that will require a high level of commitment. T&lt;br/&gt;his can be done, it has been done, people have battled through far more challenging roads that I really have&lt;br/&gt;no excuse whatsoever. What will keep me going will be my girl friend as she’ll also be battling her own battles,&lt;br/&gt;my younger brother who has a gigantic task of work studying at UPenn and the support and love from my mom and older&lt;br/&gt;brother. I can do it and I will do it!!!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Today Terah was dropped off at Dulles Airport to catch his flight heading to Orlando, Florida. As you know,&lt;br/&gt;Terah spent the holidays with us. It was a welcomed stay, both for us and for him. For us it was nice to have&lt;br/&gt;someone close to our family living in the US spending the holidays with us. For him, it must have been great to&lt;br/&gt;get away from everything, school, work and the pressure of getting his life back on track to come and spend&lt;br/&gt;time with us and see that there are other Ugandans in the US who have been through the road his embarking on.&lt;br/&gt;He has a ridiculously long road ahead of him. He has so many dreams and aspirations. I’m afraid his expectations&lt;br/&gt;are almost impossible given his circumstances today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is not an easy place to make it, the country is embedded with so many obstacles designed to slow anyone down.&lt;br/&gt;From house expenses, car expenses, school loans etc. these are merely the few among the many roadblocks in place that&lt;br/&gt;he’ll learn to deal with. Obviously anyone with smarts, vision, dream, discipline, world class desire and work ethic&lt;br/&gt;can make it anywhere including US. My main concern is that he is following his passion for music, which is admirable&lt;br/&gt;but the music industry is notorious for its uncertainty in terms of striking it big, middle wages and low job outlook.&lt;br/&gt;To me this implies that after school he&apos;s going to go through a laborious period trying to locate an entry level job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attractive approach he could have taken would have been acquiring a hard skill or an in demand skill. This insures&lt;br/&gt;that he not only has an easy road to employment after school, but will command an above salary sooner. These skills will&lt;br/&gt;also be marketable in Uganda, the country he hopes to one day go back to and conduct his music aspirations. My hope is&lt;br/&gt;that he left Northern Virginia with inspiration and hope that he too can make it in the US like many people before him.&lt;br/&gt;I don’t think it has quite sank in the amount of work it is going to take to achieve his dreams. He needs to take each&lt;br/&gt;opportunity like it’s his last, not let his passion blind side him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passion can only take you so far, if a person doesn’t have the aptitude to make tough decisions, decisions that go against&lt;br/&gt;his or her beliefs and everything they have known their entire life (beliefs, ideologies, values etc), career (choosing&lt;br/&gt;another path/ making a one eighty) that person does not have what it takes to be great!! In his situation, Terah has to be a&lt;br/&gt;shark, ruthless and merciless, and last but not least have a world class work ethic!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CNU friends at Buffalo Winds</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/cnu-friends-at-buffalo-wings.html</link>

	&lt;p&gt;Today was a typical day in my shoes; mellow much of the day with a sharp up tick towards the evening.&lt;br/&gt;Nothing really exciting happened during the day just worked really hard at Gumax International making&lt;br/&gt;pies with Terah. The highlight of the day was having dinner with my CNU friends at Buffalo Wings&lt;br/&gt;Factory and shortly following that going bowling at Bowl America with my lovely and always wonderful&lt;br/&gt;girlfriend Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to great stories, I will start this conversation from the beginning so you can walk in my shoes on&lt;br/&gt;this particular day. Feeling ambiguous the night before, I set the alarm clock to 700am in order to have&lt;br/&gt;enough time to prepare and head out to Gumax International and be there around 800am (Its funny&lt;br/&gt;how the world works, you can start set you mind to something but then totally get complacent for one&lt;br/&gt;reason or the other). In reality, I managed to get out of bed around 735am sluggishly and painfully&lt;br/&gt;trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I’m running a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terah and I finally arrived at Gumax International around 840am. Because today Terah was tagging&lt;br/&gt;along, instead of driving to the office as usual, we directly drove out to Guma’s house. The night before I&lt;br/&gt;spoke to Mr. Guma about today’s objectives and he insisted that we head to the house in the morning&lt;br/&gt;to work on the products and that we would be working with a Ugandan helper (embarrassingly I do not&lt;br/&gt;remember her name even after all these days working with her). At the house, Ugandan helper and&lt;br/&gt;Terah were well acquainted. They both had a lot in common largely because both of them had strong&lt;br/&gt;ties to Uganda. At this point, Terah has been living in the States for about 5 months making him very&lt;br/&gt;fresh and still remembers the economic, social and political affairs of Uganda. On the other token,&lt;br/&gt;Ugandan helper is roughly 70 years old (totally guessing so take the age for what its worth) and had&lt;br/&gt;lived in Uganda all of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hinted above, this turned out to be quite an enjoyable day for me listening to the different&lt;br/&gt;conversations that aroused during the course of the day. Topics span from Education and Jobs in Uganda&lt;br/&gt;to girls and how to staying away from crazy unpredictable girls in the US. From today I can honestly say&lt;br/&gt;that Terah is a genuine man, humble, goal orientated and smart caught at the wrong side of the life. His&lt;br/&gt;step in life took him in a corner of which he totally does not deserve. Life is not kind and it’s a shame. So&lt;br/&gt;there I will leave it at that. Let’s move on shall we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is ridiculous; don’t know if you will be reading this (Alex Makumbi) or someone else (Stranger)&lt;br/&gt;but whoever it is let me explain. Today is Jan 04 2016, and kid you not; Guma still has not paid me for&lt;br/&gt;November 2015 even after emailing him my hours. Here is my predicament, in less than a week, I have&lt;br/&gt;to pay a credit card bill of about $250, have to pay school fees soon of about $700 and need some spare&lt;br/&gt;money to take out my girl friend before she heads out to school and need to pay for gas. Stress levels&lt;br/&gt;are mounting at this point because his holding me hostage. I’ll surely discuss the situation with him&lt;br/&gt;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work ended at around 400pm. We managed to make back home around 435pm leaving me with little&lt;br/&gt;time to get ready for my dinner with Steve Landry. A brief back story about Landry, we played soccer&lt;br/&gt;together at CNU and he consistently was there for me willing to get dinner with me and always willing to&lt;br/&gt;hang out with me. I hold him at high regards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrived at our meeting point at Buffalo Wings Factory in Chantilly on time. Landry didn’t end up arriving&lt;br/&gt;unit about 20mins late. We all walked in the restaurant together. At the restaurant joining us was Chung&lt;br/&gt;Money (currently in grad school studying PT), and two other CNU buddies. Dinner was lovely; as always&lt;br/&gt;Steve was the center of it all with endless stories of what our classmates we knew were currently doing.&lt;br/&gt;Most was positive it seems everyone is working hard starting at the bottom in entry level jobs renting&lt;br/&gt;out apartments contemplating on what city to move to and whether to stay in a particular job for a&lt;br/&gt;certain period of time or not - basically doing what I am doing now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending on a good note, Steve Landry’s birthday is Jan 26 2016. Very much would love to celebrate with&lt;br/&gt;him but knowing me I probably will not get the chance. After dinner I met up with Mary and took her&lt;br/&gt;Bowling. Probably the highlight of my night/day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roller-coaster of emotions</title>

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;The only fitting description for today would be roller-coaster of emotions. The day began in unexpected&lt;br/&gt;fashion. I woke up bright and early at around 830 just in time for the Chelsea verse Cristal Palace.&lt;br/&gt;Embarking on a new day my mind was empty free of any outside problems, the only objective at the&lt;br/&gt;time was to brash my teeth, walk downstairs to the sitting room and connect my laptop to the television&lt;br/&gt;and live stream the game. Feeling a bit hungry walked into the kitchen finding mom cleaning the dishes.&lt;br/&gt;Politely greeted her and acquired on if she had good sleep. To my surprise, she was in a terrible mood&lt;br/&gt;(as though the whole night she had been playing with random thoughts, juggling trying to make out all&lt;br/&gt;of them at once only to foggy up her mind at a point when she cannot remember why she was feeling&lt;br/&gt;the way she was or why she was trying to understand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was clearly not happy with me because in her mind I was extremely rude and not helpful in the&lt;br/&gt;vehicle search the day before. It all began yesterday during the day. Around noon she forwarded on my&lt;br/&gt;email a list of about 6 – 7 vehicles she had found on craigslist. Obviously in a different state of mind I&lt;br/&gt;lethargically quickly glanced at the list of vehicles and found that the majority of vehicles were above&lt;br/&gt;our budget so I dismissed the whole list entirely since in reality to me it didn’t matter. And since&lt;br/&gt;Woodbridge Auto Action had our deposit of $300, I thought it would be in our best interest to look at&lt;br/&gt;vehicles there so we do not lose our money. After doing a quick search I came across 4 vehicles in great&lt;br/&gt;condition and in our budget so I showed her pictures along with there basic specs (mileage, condition&lt;br/&gt;etc.). To my surprise she loved the vehicles and even proposed that we head over to the dealership that&lt;br/&gt;evening since it was slow day and it would be nice get this car search over with before everyone gets&lt;br/&gt;busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the dealership, after looking at several cars we landed on a 2010 Hyundai Sonata. The vehicle was in&lt;br/&gt;great condition partly because the car was only 5 years old. The engine was very quite which apparently&lt;br/&gt;implies the vehicle should be able to run for another 30,000 miles. With that said, the car had extremely&lt;br/&gt;high millage, 88,000 miles more than our cut off mileage conflicting with one of mom’s top conditions.&lt;br/&gt;Her conditions were that we stay away from cars that have more than 150k miles, stay away from two&lt;br/&gt;doors, stay away from cars not made in Asia and obviously stay away from poorly maintained cars&lt;br/&gt;including cars that smelled like cigarettes. We loved the car so much that we ended up placing a deposit&lt;br/&gt;of 3k and we also managed to transfer our initial deposit of $300 on the 2010 Hyundai Sonata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see I was extremely surprised to wake up in the morning to find mom in the kitchen very&lt;br/&gt;angry with me. Her reason was that I did not care about the list of vehicles she had sent me on the&lt;br/&gt;email. Yes, I felt sorry for not paying much attention to the list, but to my defense she sent me mixed&lt;br/&gt;signals. She shouldn’t have sent me cars priced above our budget. Including cars priced above the&lt;br/&gt;budget gave the notion that each car on the list was above the budge when in reality she had imbedded&lt;br/&gt;cars below the budget that she really wanted me to look at. I understand that I should have taken the&lt;br/&gt;email seriously, but with the same token she should take some of the responsibility. For one, if you want&lt;br/&gt;me to look at two cars, don’t send me 5 other cars priced above the budget. Two, you placed a deposit&lt;br/&gt;on the Hyundai knowingly that we would be short 1k, so you shouldn’t pin the blame on me because&lt;br/&gt;ultimately you had the final say in the matter and that you should have used good judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I managed to catch the second half of the Chelsea game. Willian had an amazing game,&lt;br/&gt;absolutely brilliant constantly making things happen whenever he had the ball and scoring the second&lt;br/&gt;goal securing the win. Total score (3-0) Chelsea. Sadly that was the only highlight of my Sunday. My&lt;br/&gt;mind was clouded from my discussion with mom, I just couldn’t understand, my intentions were good,&lt;br/&gt;yes I was a bit lazy one point or another during the process but I didn’t think it was fair to pin the blame&lt;br/&gt;squarely on me. We did not make a mistake because we all agree the car is great, however she’s&lt;br/&gt;thinking on what ifs; what ifs meaning we could have gotten a cheaper car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day I took time to surf the web for cheap apartments and garages that would take our vehicle&lt;br/&gt;for a good price. Made a call and briefly talked to Herbert to get advice on how to go about scrapping&lt;br/&gt;the car. He really didn’t give me information that I already didn’t know but it was nice talking to him it&lt;br/&gt;had been a while. Afterwards I sluggishly went upstairs and read a Time Magazine on Steve Jobs. I was&lt;br/&gt;there for the reminder of the day and didn’t come down until the sun was down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The optimistic view of 2016</title>

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;At this time each year I take a moment to reflect on the year that was. The year 2015 began with me&lt;br/&gt;knowing that I was embarking on the next phase in my life given that I had just graduated from college&lt;br/&gt;in December 2014. I had somewhat of an idea how the year would turn out; for example I had secured&lt;br/&gt;an internship with MenEngage so I knew I’ll be working in D.C but didn’t quite know how it would pan-&lt;br/&gt;out, I wasn’t totally jumping for joy about the opportunity simply glad that I wouldn’t be home searching&lt;br/&gt;for jobs. Also I knew that I would be visiting Africa for a period of time and that it would be the first time&lt;br/&gt;visiting the continent in roughly 13 years. My visit to Africa was what I looked forward to the most&lt;br/&gt;starting the year because I somehow knew it would change the course of my life (my thinking) and&lt;br/&gt;indeed my life was forever changed. This brought with it a lot of turbulence both mentally and&lt;br/&gt;professionally. The trip allowed me to rethink how I thought about careers, allowed me to look deep&lt;br/&gt;inside myself to determine truly what I wanted to do with my life - understanding what path in life&lt;br/&gt;would help me reach my burning desires. So as you can imagine, there was a lot uncertainty and&lt;br/&gt;confusion during this time. I beat myself up inside for not foreseeing and actually valuing my education before&lt;br/&gt;getting to this point, and I vow to never take life and opportunities for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Year has approached in quick fashion brining with it an abundance of optimism. There is no&lt;br/&gt;doubt that 2016 is going to be special. Special in terms of not only will it be my second year in the real&lt;br/&gt;world, but this year I’ll consume more information that I have consumed last year and the year before.&lt;br/&gt;For starters, I’ll continue with course work at UMUC, in fact, in total I’ll be taking 7 courses in Software&lt;br/&gt;Development and Security. On top of that, during the summer I’ll aim to secure an internship to&lt;br/&gt;supplement my education and gain real work experience and make connections in the software field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, in 2016, I’ll continue assisting Mr. Augustine Guma with is Start-Up Gumax International. This&lt;br/&gt;year Gumax International is expended to open a brand new restaurant in Woodbridge called Gumax&lt;br/&gt;Spicy Pies which is projected to generate a lot of revenue for the company. Before 2015 ended&lt;br/&gt;customers were placing in orders for the products so all these positive signs imply that the restaurant&lt;br/&gt;will be welcomingly busy. Another thing to look forward to is that Gumax International was picked as&lt;br/&gt;one of the vendors at the Super Bowl in San Francisco this coming February. I hope Guma picks me to&lt;br/&gt;attend such a massive event. Lastly, I’ll experience first hand how it’s like to work as a staff accountant&lt;br/&gt;during tax season. During this period my accountancy skills will truly be enhance expanding my brain&lt;br/&gt;farther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot write a first blog without mentioning the people in my life that make my life happen and&lt;br/&gt;enjoyable. There is one thing that I’ve learned in this world no one no matter how successful someone is&lt;br/&gt;no one goes through life by themselves. Each year as life happens people enter and leave your life -&lt;br/&gt;some enhance your life making you a better person emotionally, professionally or economically, and&lt;br/&gt;some enter your life to only pull you back. On August 16 th 2015, I was able to have the girl of my dreams&lt;br/&gt;enter my life. She not only makes my heart sing sounds of joy each time I see her, but she stimulates my&lt;br/&gt;brain and my thinking each time we talk. I look forward sharing my journey with her this year. My family&lt;br/&gt;also plays a massive roll; they are always supportive, always patent with me and are always looking out&lt;br/&gt;for my best interest even when I cannot see it at the time. I love all of them and cannot wait to make&lt;br/&gt;them proud some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever reads this post, thank you for reading. &lt;/p&gt;
