	&lt;h2&gt;Least privilege&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture and Design Considerations for Secure Software by Software Assurance says that least privilege is a principle that each component, including components from the outside world and components embedded into the program, and every user of the system, use the least set of privilege necessary to accomplish desired tasks and objectives. The objective of employing least privilege principle is to reduce the number of actors (components and users) in the system who are granted high levels of privilege, and the duration of time each actor can hold onto those privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benefit for employing the least privilege principle manifests in the way project stake holders (programmers, system administers etc..) look at security measures. The military has a saying’ - “need to know bases”. Those few words encapsulate the framework of which stake holders view the project and at the core of how they handle decisions. The unintentional, unwanted, or improper use of privileges are less likely to take place since the minimum amount of privileges are granted to users and components (Langford Jeff, 2003). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benefit which does not come much as a surprise is that it is fundamentally and practically harder to reduce access privileges for actors when each actor is given a maximum amount of privileges at the beginning, than it when actors are given the least amount of privileges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we discussed requirements misuse/abuse cases and used an ATM machine as an example. This week I will use the ATM machine again to explain how least privilege principle is employed and the reasons for using the principle. An ATM is made to be simple. Customers are allowed access to deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and inquiry. Customers cannot communicate with their respective bank edit their profiles, edit bank pin, change username, edit account and routing number. Employing this principle limits the damage that can result from an accident or error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t expose vulnerable or high-consequence components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you host a large gathering at your home chances are that you will not leave a large ward of cash laying in the sitting room, or your passport visa along with your social security number on the kitchen table. These are high-consequence items that are being exposed to a large group of not very well unknown people. In software development a program usually hosts sensitive business data, personal identifiable information (PII), sensitive program executables and functions. These high consequence components should not be exposed to non-consequence components, meaning that high-consequence components should be stored separately from non-consequence components. The passport visa, social security number, and the large ward of cash should be placed in a boxed safe stored in a low traffic area such a locked bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits and Examples&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exposing vulnerable or high-consequence components means that you are actively and deliberately isolating trusted entities from untrusted entities. For example, program data executables and configuration data would be stored in a different location with the assumption that environment data is not trustworthy. This deliberate isolation of trusted entities from untrusted entities naturally reduces the attack surface and here is why. Going back to our house analogy, the act of removing passport visa and social security number along with the large ward of cash from the kitchen to a safe box in a locked bedroom drastically reduces the attack surface to one point of entry. It is easier to keep a recorded log of activities in a bedroom compared to an open concept kitchen. As a result, the attacker has a harder time locating and gaining access on vulnerable or high-consequence components because the attacker is left guessing where vulnerable/high-consequence components could be held his given limited resources to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complete mediation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete mediation design principle is a mechanism of which a software system systematically checks required access an object has each time that object attempts to access any type of resource. A reference monitor is a piece of software that checks every reference made by subjects to objects (Implementing Complete Mediation, by Schneider). To find out why reference monitor is critical for complete mediation, we use a simple example, if the access control rights of a subject are decreased after the first time rights are granted and the system does not check the next access to that object, security vulnerabilities can occur throughout the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When we say object, it can mean the various components that encompass the whole system (including sub-components), outside plugins or software, users etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Assurance (SwA) Pocket Guide Resources in an article titled Architecture and Design Considerations for Secure Software stated it accurately writing that complete mediation is the “primary underpinning of the protection system” (Software Assurance, 2008). The consistent evaluation of subject’s access to objects not only ensures that no permission violations can occur, but also makes it easier to log successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts on resources. A benefit would then be that during a security breach, swift actions can be taken to mitigate damage since access to various components is accurately logged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past fall 16’ I was a Software Developer Intern for a startup creating batteries for electric vehicles. My role as a back-end developer exposed me to Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud ecosystem. AWS employs complete mediation. In AWS ecosystem each user, AWS tool, and outside plugins are given various levels of access. The AWS administrator controls the amount of access each entity possesses. To give an example, for the Lambda Function to filter data coming from our API Gateway and then store the appropriate data in DynamoDB, the Lambda Function had to get appropriate permission from DynamoDB by triggering the two together. In order for the API Gateway to send raw data in Lambda Function, Lambda Function and API Gateway both had to be triggered together with the appropriate access. Lastly, the API Gateway had to establish appropriate access level with an outside entity where the data would be generated which in our case was customer purchase orders using a third party platform. Any change in access level along the chain causes the entire system to break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Psychological acceptability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological acceptability design principle is another way of saying software system design should be intuitive to any user, particularly the client side. In my view, to achieve an easy to understand or intuitive user interface (UX), the design should also follow established guidelines for supporting accessibility of disabled people. There are more than one billion people with various disabilities all around the world, of whom approximately 285 million are visually-impaired and 360 million hearing impaired (Rezaei A. Yashar, Heisenberg Gernot, and Heiden Wolfgang, 2014). With this approach, impaired users not only are able to easily apply protection mechanisms correctly, regular users are able to do so as well, increasing the security of the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching benefit that derives from employing psychological acceptability design principle is the drastic reduction of mistakes on the part of the user. The reduction of mistakes in tern translate to a more robust secure system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Examples&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user must become involved in security decisions at some point. Either when the system is loading or when the system attempts a privileged operation. To use an everyday example, today it seems every company is using an interactive map for something. In order for an application to retrieve a user’s geolocation, by law the application has to prompt the user for access. Another example is whenever a user installs an application from an outside source, they are to be prompted for access of resources to be used and how they are to be used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minimize the number of high-consequence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design principle of minimizing the number of high-consequence components from security risk employs the least privilege principle, separation of privilege, duties, and roles and separation of domains. The key concept of the design principle is to reduce the number of high-consequence components from risk. For example, to separate environments that are not trusted from trusted environments, and reduce the number of entities interacting with the high-consequence components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits and Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of least privilege to minimize the number of high-consequence ensures the number of actors in the system that are granted high levels of privilege is reduced strengthening overall security. Another benefit derived from minimize the number of high-consequence is that the separation of domains makes it easier to implement separation of privileges, duties, and duties (Software Assurance Pocket Guide Series).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2017/personal-identifiable-information.html</link>

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/re-creditcardform.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit Card Entry Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal identifiable information or PII is practically any piece of information about someone maintained by an organization that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity. Information can include but not limited to name, social security number, date of birth as well as any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PII examples are listed below by no means exhaust possibilities of information that could be considered PII. This is only meant to highlight/provide a framework as of what PII information can encompass. Examples include financial transactions, medical history, criminal history, employment history, individual ‘s name, social security number, passport number, driver‘s license number, credit card number, vehicle registration among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Figure 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/re-newsupdate.png&quot; alt=&quot;News Update form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In figure 1, PII data that is being gathered from the form is title, first name, middle name and last name, address, email, and phone number. The purpose for the form is to allow people to subscribe for bi-weekly e-newsletter. This form asks people to enter (optionally) their addresses which is not necessary for a bi-weekly e-newsletter. If I worked for vendor and was tasked to improve security, I would first assess the impact level of storing and maintaining address information. I would conclude that the impact level of storing and maintaining address information is moderate since the expected loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could have serious adverse effect on individuals. As a result, I would lean on the side of cation by removing address from the form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Figure 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/re-winmoney.png&quot; alt=&quot;Win $10,000,000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In figure 2, PII data that is being gathered from the form is name, address and data of birth in order to register to win $10,000,000 dollars. The fact that the form is asking for address is a slight over reach, and here is why, secure software development best practices show that a minimum number of information required to accomplish a particular task is needed - nothing more nothing less. If I worked for the vendor and was tasked to improve security, a possible way I would mitigate this is issue is by removing address from the form and instead wait until the participant has qualified to win the prize to solicit address information if it is needed. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Requirements Misuse and Abuse Cases</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2017/requirements-misuse-and-abuse-cases.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2017/requirements-misuse-and-abuse-cases.html</guid>
      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;We attempt to explain briefly what misuse/abuse cases are and why applying the concept in the development stage of software requirements results in a more robust secure product. Programmers generally create use case diagrams to demonstrate functions, flow and actions that the end-user and the application will perform, this ensures the program functions as it should and meets all the desired requirements. Misuse or abuse cases are similar to use cases, only that with misuse/abuse cases the developer has to place themselves in the shoes of an attacker. The programmer walks through functions, flow and actions of the program with the lenses of an attacker – how will the application or user handle the application in a way that is not intended. Misuse cases provide opportunities to investigate and validate security requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ATM abuse/misuse cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/re-atm-system.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atm System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The ATM System use cases diagram is displayed above. Use cases diagrams can also be viewed on the following links: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/cs211/ATMExample/UseCases.html&quot; title=&quot;ATM Use Cases&quot;&gt;ATM Example Use Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/courses/cs211/ATMExample/Interactions.html#Startup&quot; title=&quot;Startup Use Case&quot;&gt;ATM Operator Startup Use Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Start-up Use Case&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before bank customers can begin using the ATM machine, an ATM system operator first has to Start Up the system following this sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.  Switch on operator panel
2.  Get initial cash in the ATM 
3.  Set initial cash into cash dispenser 
4.  Then open connection to the bank
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Start-up Misuse/Abuse Case&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sequence, operator panel being switched on, does not appear to have contingencies in place that authenticates the operator. As a result, what will most likely happen is &lt;strong&gt;broken authentication&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;session management&lt;/strong&gt; allowing a malicious user to compromise the entire system placing customer’s personal identifiable information (PII) in danger. To mitigate this threat, operator panel has to prompt user to enter username and password for user authentication. To mitigate &lt;strong&gt;brute force authentication&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;guess valid user accounts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dictionary attacks&lt;/strong&gt;, a generic error message is shown when authentication fails as well as locking the system after N failed login attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, at the moment once the operator set initial cash into cash dispenser a connection to the bank is established. A vulnerability that can occur is &lt;strong&gt;missing function level access control&lt;/strong&gt;. This is when a request is not verified, enabling an attacker to forge requests in order to access functionality without proper authorization. To mitigate this vulnerability, operator should be required to enter pin before a connection is established with bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Session Use Case&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After start-up sequence is successful customers are free to begin sessions. Sessions should follow the following sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.  Valid bank card inserted into ATM
2.  Session is created. Reading card. If card is valid request to enter pin, if card is not valid terminate session.
3.  User enters valid pin 
4.  If pin valid, user can perform following transactions
        a. Withdrawal
        b. Deposit
        c. Transfer
        d. Inquiry
5.  User cancels session (this can be done at any stage of session)
6.  Card ejected
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Session Misuse/Abuse Case&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ATM has detected the inserted bank card is valid, the customer is prompted to enter a four-digit pin. This user authentication is threatened by &lt;strong&gt;brute force authentication&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dictionary attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. To mitigate these threats, the ATM should lock account after N failed login attempts as well as validate the minimum length and complexity of pin. It is important that when user enters wrong pin a generic error message is shown to ensure that an attacker is not provided clues as to which user account is stored in the bank. All these implemented measures collectively in return mitigate &lt;strong&gt;broken authentication&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;session management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Transaction Use Case&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a successful pin validation, customer is presented with four transaction options: withdrawal, deposit, transfer, and inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Transaction Misuse/Abuse Case&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to mitigate the threat of &lt;strong&gt;sensitive data exposer&lt;/strong&gt;, it is critical that the ATM displays the minimum number of information for each transaction. To give an example, let’s say a customer wants to withdrawal N amount from checking account. If N amount is more than amount in checking account, the ATM system should display a generic message ensuring PII is protected. To take it further, for each transaction, whether it is withdrawal, deposit, transfer, or inquiry, the customer needs to be prompted with a message asking for a confirmation to carry out an action. This will ensure that &lt;strong&gt;missing function level access control&lt;/strong&gt; is mitigated to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Training</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2017/sdlc-training.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2017/sdlc-training.html</guid>
      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;This article allows me to demonstrate the importance of secure training in preparation of software development life-cycles. I will be discussing the importance of security training in preparation for secure software development, providing five reasons for the importance of security training prior to executing the SDL process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Meet current and evolving business and compliance needs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations face new threats each year that aim at causing damage or compromise critical assets or degrade public trust through data dumps among others. The most effective way to keep on par with evolving threats is to prioritize business security training in preparation for secure software development. Security training ensures that as business requirements change, employees are in position to conceptualize and focus on employing secure software development practices and techniques, assuring that critical assets are adequately protected. Hence, through security training, a business requirements approach to developing software is taken as a posed to adversarial approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Keep pace with emerging security technologies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above we mentioned that each year brings an evolution of new threats, this is largely due to the emergence of new technologies, such as Web 2.0 and Internet applications. For this reason, existing skill sets often fall behind the evolution weakening the capabilities to stay on par with security threats. Annual security training ensures that employees are trained on security technologies that work to make sure there is no unexpectedly unprotected product. Statistics from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/publications/index.cfm&quot;&gt;United States Computer Emergency Response Team&lt;/a&gt; (CERT) show a rapid progression in total software vulnerabilities catalogued, hovering at about 7,000–8,000 per year during 2006 through 2008, up from about 1,100 in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deepen stakeholder security specialized knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does annual security training ensure that employees are keeping pace with emergence of new threats, technology and security technologies, the education also facilitates a deeper understanding of software security allowing for further mitigation of security vulnerabilities. An employee is able to react appropriately when situations arise that are outside training. Furthermore, through training those employees that are excited by security can serve as mentors for others helping in secure code development or use of a specific code review tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Organizational emergence of security first culture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an organization elects to focus on providing annual security training to its employees, overtime a security first culture naturally emerges permeating from executive directors all the way down to customer service representatives. An annual security training tailored to specific positions in the company facilitates this security first culture. So as you can see, security training does not begin and stop with software development, it encompasses the whole organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Future return from security trained workforce&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A security trained workforce ensures that software vulnerabilities are mitigated overtime. It is well documented that the cost savings of finding and fixing vulnerabilities very early in the development cycle is significant - we cannot overlook this fact. We have to note, however, that there is no parallel correlation between software vulnerabilities and material loss, but with an emergence of new technologies the best way to ensure a reduction of vulnerabilities is by a security trained workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Process Comparison</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2017/sdlc-process-comparison.html</link>

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;This article allows me to demonstrate my current understanding of the various software development life-cycles. I will be selecting two traditional Software Engineering Phases and compare and contrast each of them focusing on: How they differ? How they are similar? And define one advantage and one disadvantage for each SDLC process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a well-defined, structured sequence of stages in software engineering to develop an intended software product. SDLC provides as series of steps to be followed to design and develop a software product efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These steps include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is the step that a user (customer) approaches a software developer or software company requesting for a desired software product. The user submits is desired software product in a document explaining how he/she wants it to function etc.…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement Gathering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From now onwards the software developer or software company takes over. A brainstorming process takes place. Each stakeholder of the product is interviewed to learn as much as possible about the requirements of the product. Questionnaires are handed out among others. The objective in this phase is to gather as much information as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After gathering required information from end users, the software developer(s) or software company analyzes whether a software can be made that address all required requirements. And if such a software can be made; are algorithms available? Is the technology feasible? How many developers are needed? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this stage, developers decide how they are to execute the project. They understand the product’s limitations, the system’s related potential problems identifying and addressing the impact of project on organization and people using software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This step brings down gathered requirements and system analysis and design the software product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in a suitable programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Software testing is done while coding by the developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing and testing the product at user’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Software may need to be integrated with the libraries, databases and other program(s). This stage of SDLC is involved in the integration of software with outer world entities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterfall Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterfall model is a sequential model. Software development is divided into separate phases and each phase is dependent on the success of the previous phase. The output of the one phase is the input of the other, so it is mandatory for the first phase to be completed before moving on to the next phase. The model assumes that everything produced in the previous step has no issues whatsoever because the model does not allow to go back and undo or redo our actions. In short, the development of one phase starts only when the previous phase is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterative model allows software developers to receive quick feedback at every stage of the development process. To give a simple illustration on how the model works; let’s say we are developing a small feature on our product, once we finish that feature we immediately test it to analyze how it functions, then using results gathered the test we go back to designing the feature making improvements. From there we continue coding and maybe expanding the feature. The process repeats until a large-scale software product is produced. As you can see, this model leads the software development process in iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarities between waterfall model and iterative model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, there are few similarities between waterfall model and iterative model. One similarly that comes to mind is the ease at which both models can be implemented. Waterfall model being systematic by nature requiring that an output of the one phase is the input of the other - first phase to be completed before moving on to the next phase. Iterative model is cyclical – design, code, test and verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differences between waterfall model and iterative model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent differences between waterfall model and iterative model is the framework for software development process. As outlined above, waterfall model declares that the first step must be completed before moving onto the next step. Going further, it also assumes that everything produced in the previous step has no issues whatsoever and so it does not allow you to undo or redo actions. The waterfall model goes against the core structure of iterative model, in that unlike waterfall model, iterative model is designed to provide constant feedback by way of constant testing, evaluating, designing, verifying and repeating the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One advantage for waterfall:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterfall model is simple and easy to understand and use because stages are clearly defined and done one at a time. As a result, it is easy to make a prediction regarding the size, cost, and timeline of the project, as well as knowing how the finished product will turn out at the end of development. This model is great for small projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One advantage for Iterative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key advantage for implementing iterative model for software development process is that it allows products to be built and improved step by step. As a result, defects are able to be detected in early stages due to quick reliable feedback. This model is perfect for technology start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One disadvantage for waterfall model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we briefly touched on earlier in the post, waterfall model assumes that everything produced in the previous step has no issues whatsoever because the model does not allow to go back and undo or redo our actions. The development of one phase starts only when the previous phase is complete which is a major disadvantage. In software development, without adequate testing and feedback from end users, the likelihood of undetected defects in the software is high. It becomes very costly and difficult to go back and fix changes in large programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One disadvantage for iterative model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterative model allows for quick feedback, which means projects are ever changing. For instance, the end of project may not be known until the project is fully compete. This uncertainty could mean project budget costs are unknown, on top of that, attention to risk analysis is higher compared to other models.&lt;/p&gt;

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;In this article I create a simple form to demonstrate insecure interaction between a java based component&lt;br/&gt;and the outside world explaining why the form poses as a vulnerability to the overall application.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, I show how to properly secure the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple Java application is created with a simple login form that retrieves username and password using&lt;br/&gt;two JTextFields and storing them into the Derby Database.&lt;/p&gt;

    }
    
    private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        {
            createConnection();
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute(&amp;quot;insert into &amp;quot; + tableName + &amp;quot; values (&amp;#39;&amp;quot; +
                    userName + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&amp;quot; + userPass + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;);
            
            stmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    
   
    private static void shutdown()
    {
        try
        {
            if (stmt != null)
            {
                stmt.close();
            }
            if (conn != null)
            {
                DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL + &amp;quot;;shutdown=true&amp;quot;);
                conn.close();
            }           
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.getStackTrace();
        }

    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once login button is pressed, the username and password is sent to be stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The simple login application does not take into account other software vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;We’re only demonstrating SQL Injection vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application works great, but when we take a look under the hood we find that this application is vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;to SQL Injection attacks because SQL statements are not prepared and are dynamically storing data directly into&lt;br/&gt;the database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insecure Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        {
            createConnection();
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute(&amp;quot;insert into &amp;quot; + tableName + &amp;quot; values (&amp;#39;&amp;quot; +
                    userName + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&amp;quot; + userPass + &amp;quot;&amp;#39;)&amp;quot;);
            
            stmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL Injection attacks are the most prevent attacks to an application and inflicts the most damage exposing&lt;br/&gt;sensitive data. Injection attacks attempt to break into application databases by injecting malicious code,&lt;br/&gt;oftentimes in a form of SQL statements. They are often injected through form fields similar to the small&lt;br/&gt;application I created, but are also injected through uploads, 3rd party APIs, configuration files, input files etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Secured Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code snippet above shows the application retrieving username and password directly placing it into the SQL&lt;br/&gt;statement without validating or sanitizing the data. Essentially, the developer trusts the user not to&lt;br/&gt;inject malicious code. The user should never be trusted. Below I demonstrate how to properly prepare SQL statements&lt;br/&gt;in java. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        { 
            // establish connection
            createConnection();
            String qTxt = &amp;quot;INSERT INTO &amp;quot; + tableName + &amp;quot;VALUES (?,?)&amp;quot;;
            prepStmt = conn.prepareStatement(qTxt);
            prepStmt.setString(1, userName);
            prepStmt.setString(1, userPass);
            
            prepStmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When SQL statements are prepared information received from the user is placed in a prepared statement and not directly&lt;br/&gt;into the SQL query, thus mitigating dynamic queries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this demonstration, I have alluded to mention another measure to take in order to mitigate SQL Injection attacks,&lt;br/&gt;which is to validate and sanitize data retrieved from the user. As we’ve mentioned, the application cannot trust data&lt;br/&gt;from the outside world. Information must be validated for content, length, format, and other factors before use. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Database Comparison: Oracle 12c vs. Amazon DynamoDB</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/db-comparison-oracle-vs-dynamo.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">blog/2016/db-comparison-oracle-vs-dynamo.html</guid>
      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;You successfully applied and landed one of your biggest contracts that expects you to design, manage and scale a database for a medium size manufacturing and distribution company. Business requirements state that the database must be hosted in the cloud. After conducting research, you’ve landed on two of the most popular databases Amazon DynamoDB and Oracle 12c. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo is Amazon’s managed NoSQL service known for its strong consistency and predictable performance. Its design feature is quite different from Oracle 12c, a Relational Database. Instead of the relational model, Dynamo uses alternate models for data management, such as key-value pairs or document storage. Comparisons of health, storage, and network connectivity between Oracle and Dynamo was a challenge since Dynamo is a managed service, meaning that Amazon Web Services provisions and running of infrastructure are handled for users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Oracle 12c is a version of the Oracle Database which can be referred to as an Oracle Relational Database Management System, an object-relational database management system. Oracle 12c is a cloud enabled database, the ‘c’ on the 12 indicates ‘cloud’. The database features include a multi-tenant option that help users bring together databases into a private or public clouds with the added capacity to share the same hardware, platform, and network making it ideal for the distribution side of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which database should be implemented for the business, whether that is Dynamo or Oracle 12c, a database system must have scalable and robust mechanisms for its basic functions which include consistent storing, modifying, and retrieving data while efficiently handling failure detection, failure recovery, overloading handling, system monitoring among others. I find that discussing every detail of each mechanism to make a comparison between the two databases will eat up a lot of paper, and frankly would be missing the mark. Instead the discussion will focus on the three core system features used in Oracle 12c and Dynamo and compare the differences in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Storage Structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike NoSQL ecosystems, relational databases such as Oracle 12c have to allocate space for tablespace which are physically stored in data files. Each tablespace consists of one or more data files which mold to the host’s operating system where the database is running. The allocated disk space is formatted but contains no user data, so as the data grows space is used to allocate extents for the segment. Another distinction is that in Oracle 12c every data file is either online or offline. The administrator has ability to determine when data files are available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another note is that Oracle 12c leans on control files that serve multiple important roles in the overall functionality of managed data files. They contain data files, online redo files, and others needed to open the database. Structural changes to the database are also monitored and tracked. Metadata must be accessible when the database is not open, so it is the control file’s job to provide checkpoints where instance recovery would be required to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect against data loss, Oracle 12c maintains online redo log files so that data not yet written to data files is able to be retrieved after an instance failure. It is able to do this because server processes write every transaction synchronously to the redo log buffer. Online redo log always contains the undo data for permanent objects. Unlike Dynamo, with Oracle 12c the administrator is able to configure the database to store all undo data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo fundamentally differs from Oracle storage system in terms of the aim of its requirements. Dynamo was created with the mindset that applications using it will always be “writeable”, and to achieve this, data store mechanisms were made to always update regardless of server failures or concurrent writes. This is a common requirement for many NoSQL ecosystems including of course Amazon applications, bringing us to another distinction. Dynamo is built for an infrastructure within a single domain where all nodes are assumed to be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the requirements that make Dynamo unique is its ability to scale incrementally and the use of vector clocks. To allow for this mechanism of scaling incrementally, its storage structures dynamically partition data over a set of nodes in the system. In particular, Dynamo’s partitioning relies on consistent hashing to distribute the load across multiple storage hosts which allows it to scale extremely fast at short amount of time. Dynamo uses vector clocks to capture events between different versions of the same object. A vector clock is essentially a list of node pairs and each clock is associated with version of every object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical Storage Structures&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data in Oracle is stored in data block, extent, segment and tablespace; however, some of these storage hierarchy can be found inside one another. For example, a segment is a set of allocated specific database table and a table is a storage unit that contains one or more segments. Each segment belongs to one tablespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ll find later, Dynamo’s partition settings are dynamically increased depending on the throughput. Oracle has a similar mechanism for keeping track and allocating additional storage in tablespace or retracting storage when an object no longer requires it. To achieve this, Oracle uses bitmaps in the tablespace which are aside for a bitmap. Automatic Segment Space Management method uses these bitmaps to manage space in a tablespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Oracle user is assigned a default permanent tablespace. Tablespaces control disk space allocation of data, control tablespace online and offline, perform backup and recovery and export and import application data. Temporary tablespace is also deployed when a permanent tablespace is operational, however its data lasts only for the duration of a session. They serve to improve the efficiency of space management operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo is a fully managed document database service running in the AWS cloud that provides very fast and predictable performance. The database is optimized to retrieve and store semi-structured data as documents, formatted in JSON or XML. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data in Dynamo is stored in partitions which are basically an allocated storage for a table, backed by solid-state drives and automatic replication across multiple available zones in AWS region. When a table is being created the database automatically allocates enough partitions so that the table can handle user set provisioned throughput requirements. And since Dynamo is designed to scale super-fast, increases in table’s provisioned throughput settings beyond what currently exists at a moment’s notice can allocate additional partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward with our discussion on logical storage structures, it is important to understand how data is handled under Dynamo’s key/value interface. Tables usually have a partition key only or a partition key and sort key. Dynamo handles the two slightly differently to optimize efficiency. Under a partition key only table, the key has to be referenced when writing and reading items. A table with partition key and sort key similar to partition key, only now items are grouped and ordered by sort key value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data processing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle being a Relational Database Management System adheres to Structured Query Language which provides the interface. All operations of the data in Oracle are performed using SQL statements. For instance, SQL statement could be used to create tables, query, and modify data in tables. A procedural extension named PL/SQL embedded with Oracle database allows developers to use all Oracle Database SQL statements, functions and data types. What is unique about this procedural extension is its ability to provide control to the flow of SQL program, variables and deployment of error-handling procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, Dynamo relies on provisioned throughput model to process data. A user is able specify read and writes via documents, such as JSON, XML declaring number of input operations that a table is expected to achieve. A user is also able to declare consistency characteristics for each read request within an application. The number of input operations can be determined by Item size, expected read and write request rates, has local or global secondary indexes etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle 12c has a domain-specific language to query data, however Dynamo provides access with a simple application programming interface to create, read, update and delete data. Dynamo also has batch operations for reading and writing multiple items/rows across multiple tables. Another feature available is an atomic item and attribute operation, which basically allows for updating, adding, deleting and item only if a certain value is present or not present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo’s impressive capabilities of taking in large amounts of data at a given notice means that it should also be able to read millions of data efficiently. To achieve this, Dynamo and many NoSQL databases support scan capabilities to address large-scale analytical processing. Dynamo’s Query API, filters and parallel scanning could be applied to narrow down result set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oracle 12c&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oracle’s relational structure organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. The schema defines the tables, columns, indexes, relationships between tables, and other database elements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A partition key is used to retrieve values, column sets, or semi-structured JSON, XML or other documents containing related item attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oracle 12c&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance is generally dependent on the disk subsystem. Optimization of queries, indexes, and table structure is required to achieve peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The performance is generally a function of the underlying hardware cluster size, network latency, and the calling application.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oracle 12c&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oracle’s structure makeup makes it easiest to scale up with faster hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamo was designed with the purpose of scaling out using distributed clusters of low-cost hardware to increase throughput without increasing latency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oracle 12c&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to store and retrieve data requests. Queries are parsed and executed by relational database management systems (RDBMS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy to retrieve and store data structures with object-based APIs. Partition keys let applications look up key-value pairs, column sets, or semi-structured documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oracle 12c&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partitions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatic Segment Space Management (ASSM) is used in conjunction with bitmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Dynamo and Oracle 12c are all excellent databases because they are capable of scaling extremely fast in a short amount of time. Deciding on what database to implement for a business setting ultimately depends on the type of data you’ll be storing, the volume of data, among others. Each database has its strength and weaknesses. While conducting research, I found that a user willing to be hands on might consider working with Oracle 12c. With Oracle, you have to provide your own hardware, for example to allocate disk space used to create room for the segments. You also have control over whether the database is online or offline, determining when data files are available. Dynamo removes you from having to think about how to set up the infrastructure because the database’s ecosystem is handled by Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each database handles instance failure different as well, I found that Oracle automatically maintains processes to write every transaction synchronously to the redo log buffer so that data not yet written to data files can be retrieved. Dynamo was designed with the expectation that failures are going to occur, so the database is constantly anticipating these anomalies, as a result, data store mechanisms were made to also update regardless of server failure. In this sense, each database handles these basic but critical functions. So in a sense both databases are similar in that they have the capabilities to handle instance failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similarity to point out is that both databases are capable of scaling extremely fast in a short amount of time, though each accomplishes this in its own unique way. We know that data is stored in partitions in Dynamo, so when a large amount of data is stored partition settings dynamically increase. And for Oracle, an Automatic Segment Space Management (ASSM) is used in conjunction with bitmaps to manage space in tablespace. In a sense, ASSM functions similar to partition settings in that storage is able to be automatically fluctuate to accommodate incoming flows of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, determining which database to use boils down to your business requirements and expectations of how data should be stored, modified or gathered. I would be remised if I did not end the discussion by mentioning one obvious distinction, which is that Oracle is a relational database management system and adheres to Structured Query Language. On the other hand, as we’ve touch on quite a bit is that Dynamo a NoSQL database relying on a provisioned throughput model to process data via documents, such as JSON and XML.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The optimistic view of 2016</title>
      <link>http://jbake.org/blog/2016/Optimistic-view-of-2016.html</link>

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;At this time each year I take a moment to reflect on the year that was. The year 2015 began with me knowing that I was embarking on the next phase in my life given that I had just graduated from college in December 2014. I had somewhat of an idea how the year would turn out; for example, I had secured an internship with MenEngage so I knew I’ll be working in D.C but didn’t quite know how it would pan-out, I wasn’t totally jumping for joy about the opportunity simply glad that I wouldn’t be home searching for jobs. Also I knew that I would be visiting Africa for a period of time and that it would be the first time visiting the continent in roughly 13 years. My visit to Africa was what I looked forward to the most starting the year because I somehow knew it would change the course of my life (my thinking) and indeed my life was forever changed. This brought with it a lot of turbulence both mentally and professionally. The trip allowed me to rethink how I thought about careers, allowed me to look deep inside myself to determine truly what I wanted to do with my life - understanding what path in life would help me reach my burning desires. So as you can imagine, there was a lot uncertainty and confusion during this time. I beat myself up inside for not foreseeing and actually valuing my education before getting to this point, and I vow to never take life and opportunities for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Year has approached in quick fashion bringing with it an abundance of optimism. There is no doubt that 2016 is going to be special. Special in terms of not only will it be my second year in the real world, but this year I’ll consume more information that I have consumed last year and the year before. For starters, I’ll continue with course work at UMUC, in fact, in total I’ll be taking 7 courses in Software Development and Security. On top of that, during the summer I’ll aim to secure an internship to supplement my education and gain real work experience and make connections in the software security field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, in 2016, I’ll continue assisting Mr. Augustine Guma with is Start-Up Gumax International. This year Gumax International is expended to open a brand new restaurant in Woodbridge called Gumax Spicy Pies which is projected to generate a lot of revenue for the company. Before 2015 ended customers were placing in orders for the products so all these positive signs imply that the restaurant will be welcomingly busy. Another thing to look forward to is that Gumax International was picked as one of the vendors at the Super Bowl in San Francisco this coming February. I hope Guma picks me to attend such a massive event. Lastly, I’ll experience first hand how it’s like to work as a staff accountant during tax season. During this period my accountancy skills will truly be enhance expanding my brain further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot write a first blog without mentioning the people in my life that make my life happen and enjoyable. There is one thing that I’ve learned in this world no one no matter how successful someone is no one goes through life by themselves. Each year as life happens people enter and leave your life some enhance your life making you a better person emotionally, professionally or economically, and some enter your life to only pull you back. On August 16th 2015, I was able to have the girl of my dreams enter my life. She not only makes my heart sing sounds of joy each time I see her, but she stimulates my brain and my thinking each time we talk. I look forward sharing my journey with her this year. My family also plays a massive role; they are always supportive, always patent with me and are always looking out for my best interest even when I cannot see it at the time. I love all of them and cannot wait to make them proud someday.&lt;/p&gt;
