  			<a href="blog/2017/sdlc-process-comparison.html"><h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Process Comparison</h1></a>
  			<p>14 January 2017</p>
  			<p><p>This article allows me to demonstrate my current understanding of the various software development life-cycles. I will be selecting two traditional Software Engineering Phases and compare and contrast each of them focusing on: How they differ? How they are similar? And define one advantage and one disadvantage for each SDLC process.</p>
<p>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a well-defined, structured sequence of stages in software engineering to develop an intended software product. SDLC provides as series of steps to be followed to design and develop a software product efficiently. </p>
<p>These steps include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  <p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the step that a user (customer) approaches a software developer or software company requesting for a desired software product. The user submits is desired software product in a document explaining how he/she wants it to function etc.…</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></p></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Requirement Gathering</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>From now onwards the software developer or software company takes over. A brainstorming process takes place. Each stakeholder of the product is interviewed to learn as much as possible about the requirements of the product. Questionnaires are handed out among others. The objective in this phase is to gather as much information as possible.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Feasibility Study</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>After gathering required information from end users, the software developer(s) or software company analyzes whether a software can be made that address all required requirements. And if such a software can be made; are algorithms available? Is the technology feasible? How many developers are needed? Etc.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>System Analysis</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>At this stage, developers decide how they are to execute the project. They understand the product’s limitations, the system’s related potential problems identifying and addressing the impact of project on organization and people using software.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Software Design</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This step brings down gathered requirements and system analysis and design the software product.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Coding</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in a suitable programming language.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Software testing is done while coding by the developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing and testing the product at user’s end.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Integration</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Software may need to be integrated with the libraries, databases and other program(s). This stage of SDLC is involved in the integration of software with outer world entities.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Waterfall Model</strong></p>
<p>Waterfall model is a sequential model. Software development is divided into separate phases and each phase is dependent on the success of the previous phase. The output of the one phase is the input of the other, so it is mandatory for the first phase to be completed before moving on to the next phase. The model assumes that everything produced in the previous step has no issues whatsoever because the model does not allow to go back and undo or redo our actions. In short, the development of one phase starts only when the previous phase is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Iterative Model</strong></p>
<p>Iterative model allows software developers to receive quick feedback at every stage of the development process. To give a simple illustration on how the model works; let’s say we are developing a small feature on our product, once we finish that feature we immediately test it to analyze how it functions, then using results gathered the test we go back to designing the feature making improvements. From there we continue coding and maybe expanding the feature. The process repeats until a large-scale software product is produced. As you can see, this model leads the software development process in iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Similarities between waterfall model and iterative model:</strong></p>
<p>In all fairness, there are few similarities between waterfall model and iterative model. One similarly that comes to mind is the ease at which both models can be implemented. Waterfall model being systematic by nature requiring that an output of the one phase is the input of the other - first phase to be completed before moving on to the next phase. Iterative model is cyclical – design, code, test and verify.</p>
<p><strong>Differences between waterfall model and iterative model:</strong></p>
<p>One of the most prominent differences between waterfall model and iterative model is the framework for software development process. As outlined above, waterfall model declares that the first step must be completed before moving onto the next step. Going further, it also assumes that everything produced in the previous step has no issues whatsoever and so it does not allow you to undo or redo actions. The waterfall model goes against the core structure of iterative model, in that unlike waterfall model, iterative model is designed to provide constant feedback by way of constant testing, evaluating, designing, verifying and repeating the whole process.</p>
<p><strong>One advantage for waterfall:</strong></p>
<p>The waterfall model is simple and easy to understand and use because stages are clearly defined and done one at a time. As a result, it is easy to make a prediction regarding the size, cost, and timeline of the project, as well as knowing how the finished product will turn out at the end of development. This model is great for small projects.</p>
<p><strong>One advantage for Iterative:</strong></p>
<p>One key advantage for implementing iterative model for software development process is that it allows products to be built and improved step by step. As a result, defects are able to be detected in early stages due to quick reliable feedback. This model is perfect for technology start-ups.</p>
<p><strong>One disadvantage for waterfall model:</strong></p>
<p>As we briefly touched on earlier in the post, waterfall model assumes that everything produced in the previous step has no issues whatsoever because the model does not allow to go back and undo or redo our actions. The development of one phase starts only when the previous phase is complete which is a major disadvantage. In software development, without adequate testing and feedback from end users, the likelihood of undetected defects in the software is high. It becomes very costly and difficult to go back and fix changes in large programs.</p>
<p><strong>One disadvantage for iterative model:</strong></p>
<p>Iterative model allows for quick feedback, which means projects are ever changing. For instance, the end of project may not be known until the project is fully compete. This uncertainty could mean project budget costs are unknown, on top of that, attention to risk analysis is higher compared to other models.</p></p>

<p>Once login button is pressed, the username and password is sent to be stored in the database.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The simple login application does not take into account other software vulnerabilities.<br/>We’re only demonstrating SQL Injection vulnerability. </p>
<p>The application works great, but when we take a look under the hood we find that this application is vulnerable<br/>to SQL Injection attacks because SQL statements are not prepared and are dynamically storing data directly into<br/>the database. </p>
<h3>Insecure Code</h3>
<hr/>
<pre><code> private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        {
            createConnection();
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            stmt.execute(&quot;insert into &quot; + tableName + &quot; values (&#39;&quot; +
                    userName + &quot;&#39;, &#39;&quot; + userPass + &quot;&#39;)&quot;);
            
            stmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>SQL Injection attacks are the most prevent attacks to an application and inflicts the most damage exposing<br/>sensitive data. Injection attacks attempt to break into application databases by injecting malicious code,<br/>oftentimes in a form of SQL statements. They are often injected through form fields similar to the small<br/>application I created, but are also injected through uploads, 3rd party APIs, configuration files, input files etc. </p>
<h3>Secured Code</h3>
<hr/>
<p>The code snippet above shows the application retrieving username and password directly placing it into the SQL<br/>statement without validating or sanitizing the data. Essentially, the developer trusts the user not to<br/>inject malicious code. The user should never be trusted. Below I demonstrate how to properly prepare SQL statements<br/>in java. </p>
<pre><code>private static void insertUserInfor(String userName, String userPass)
    {
        try
        { 
            // establish connection
            createConnection();
            String qTxt = &quot;INSERT INTO &quot; + tableName + &quot;VALUES (?,?)&quot;;
            prepStmt = conn.prepareStatement(qTxt);
            prepStmt.setString(1, userName);
            prepStmt.setString(1, userPass);
            
            prepStmt.close();
        }
        catch (SQLException sqlExcept)
        {
            sqlExcept.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>When SQL statements are prepared information received from the user is placed in a prepared statement and not directly<br/>into the SQL query, thus mitigating dynamic queries. </p>
<p>In this demonstration, I have alluded to mention another measure to take in order to mitigate SQL Injection attacks,<br/>which is to validate and sanitize data retrieved from the user. As we’ve mentioned, the application cannot trust data<br/>from the outside world. Information must be validated for content, length, format, and other factors before use. </p></p>

Instead of the relational model, Dynamo uses alternate models for data management, such as key-value pairs or document storage. Comparisons of health, storage, and network connectivity between Oracle and Dynamo was a challenge since Dynamo is a managed service, meaning that Amazon Web Services provisions and running of infrastructure are handled for users. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Oracle 12c is a version of the Oracle Database which can be referred to as an Oracle Relational Database Management System, an object-relational database management system. Oracle 12c is a cloud enabled database, the ‘c’ on the 12 indicates ‘cloud’. The database features include a multi-tenant option that help users bring together databases into a private or public clouds with the added capacity to share the same hardware, platform, and network making it ideal for the distribution side of the company. </p>
<p>Regardless of which database should be implemented for the business, whether that is Dynamo or Oracle 12c, a database system must have scalable and robust mechanisms for its basic functions which include consistent storing, modifying, and retrieving data while efficiently handling failure detection, failure recovery, overloading handling, system monitoring among others. I find that discussing every detail of each mechanism to make a comparison between the two databases will eat up a lot of paper, and frankly would be missing the mark. Instead the discussion will focus on the three core system features used in Oracle 12c and Dynamo and compare the differences in the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Storage Structures</strong></p>
<p><em>Oracle</em></p>
<p>Unlike NoSQL ecosystems, relational databases such as Oracle 12c have to allocate space for tablespace which are physically stored in data files. Each tablespace consists of one or more data files which mold to the host’s operating system where the database is running. The allocated disk space is formatted but contains no user data, so as the data grows space is used to allocate extents for the segment. Another distinction is that in Oracle 12c every data file is either online or offline. The administrator has ability to determine when data files are available. </p>
<p>Another note is that Oracle 12c leans on control files that serve multiple important roles in the overall functionality of managed data files. They contain data files, online redo files, and others needed to open the database. Structural changes to the database are also monitored and tracked. Metadata must be accessible when the database is not open, so it is the control file’s job to provide checkpoints where instance recovery would be required to begin.</p>
<p>To protect against data loss, Oracle 12c maintains online redo log files so that data not yet written to data files is able to be retrieved after an instance failure. It is able to do this because server processes write every transaction synchronously to the redo log buffer. Online redo log always contains the undo data for permanent objects. Unlike Dynamo, with Oracle 12c the administrator is able to configure the database to store all undo data.</p>
<p><em>Dynamo</em></p>
<p>Dynamo fundamentally differs from Oracle storage system in terms of the aim of its requirements. Dynamo was created with the mindset that applications using it will always be “writeable”, and to achieve this, data store mechanisms were made to always update regardless of server failures or concurrent writes. This is a common requirement for many NoSQL ecosystems including of course Amazon applications, bringing us to another distinction. Dynamo is built for an infrastructure within a single domain where all nodes are assumed to be trusted. </p>
<p>Two of the requirements that make Dynamo unique is its ability to scale incrementally and the use of vector clocks. To allow for this mechanism of scaling incrementally, its storage structures dynamically partition data over a set of nodes in the system. In particular, Dynamo’s partitioning relies on consistent hashing to distribute the load across multiple storage hosts which allows it to scale extremely fast at short amount of time. Dynamo uses vector clocks to capture events between different versions of the same object. A vector clock is essentially a list of node pairs and each clock is associated with version of every object.</p>
<p><strong>Logical Storage Structures</strong> </p>
<p><em>Oracle</em></p>
<p>Data in Oracle is stored in data block, extent, segment and tablespace; however, some of these storage hierarchy can be found inside one another. For example, a segment is a set of allocated specific database table and a table is a storage unit that contains one or more segments. Each segment belongs to one tablespace.</p>
<p>As we’ll find later, Dynamo’s partition settings are dynamically increased depending on the throughput. Oracle has a similar mechanism for keeping track and allocating additional storage in tablespace or retracting storage when an object no longer requires it. To achieve this, Oracle uses bitmaps in the tablespace which are aside for a bitmap. Automatic Segment Space Management method uses these bitmaps to manage space in a tablespace.</p>
<p>Each Oracle user is assigned a default permanent tablespace. Tablespaces control disk space allocation of data, control tablespace online and offline, perform backup and recovery and export and import application data. Temporary tablespace is also deployed when a permanent tablespace is operational, however its data lasts only for the duration of a session. They serve to improve the efficiency of space management operation.</p>
<p><em>Dynamo</em></p>
<p>Dynamo is a fully managed document database service running in the AWS cloud that provides very fast and predictable performance. The database is optimized to retrieve and store semi-structured data as documents, formatted in JSON or XML. </p>
<p>Data in Dynamo is stored in partitions which are basically an allocated storage for a table, backed by solid-state drives and automatic replication across multiple available zones in AWS region. When a table is being created the database automatically allocates enough partitions so that the table can handle user set provisioned throughput requirements. And since Dynamo is designed to scale super-fast, increases in table’s provisioned throughput settings beyond what currently exists at a moment’s notice can allocate additional partitions.</p>
<p>Moving forward with our discussion on logical storage structures, it is important to understand how data is handled under Dynamo’s key/value interface. Tables usually have a partition key only or a partition key and sort key. Dynamo handles the two slightly differently to optimize efficiency. Under a partition key only table, the key has to be referenced when writing and reading items. A table with partition key and sort key similar to partition key, only now items are grouped and ordered by sort key value.</p>
<p><strong>Data processing</strong> </p>
<p><em>Oracle</em></p>
<p>Oracle being a Relational Database Management System adheres to Structured Query Language which provides the interface. All operations of the data in Oracle are performed using SQL statements. For instance, SQL statement could be used to create tables, query, and modify data in tables. A procedural extension named PL/SQL embedded with Oracle database allows developers to use all Oracle Database SQL statements, functions and data types. What is unique about this procedural extension is its ability to provide control to the flow of SQL program, variables and deployment of error-handling procedures. </p>
<p><em>Dynamo</em></p>
<p>As noted earlier, Dynamo relies on provisioned throughput model to process data. A user is able specify read and writes via documents, such as JSON, XML declaring number of input operations that a table is expected to achieve. A user is also able to declare consistency characteristics for each read request within an application. The number of input operations can be determined by Item size, expected read and write request rates, has local or global secondary indexes etc.</p>
<p>Oracle 12c has a domain-specific language to query data, however Dynamo provides access with a simple application programming interface to create, read, update and delete data. Dynamo also has batch operations for reading and writing multiple items/rows across multiple tables. Another feature available is an atomic item and attribute operation, which basically allows for updating, adding, deleting and item only if a certain value is present or not present.</p>
<p>Dynamo’s impressive capabilities of taking in large amounts of data at a given notice means that it should also be able to read millions of data efficiently. To achieve this, Dynamo and many NoSQL databases support scan capabilities to address large-scale analytical processing. Dynamo’s Query API, filters and parallel scanning could be applied to narrow down result set.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Dynamo and Oracle 12c are all excellent databases because they are capable of scaling extremely fast in a short amount of time. Deciding on what database to implement for a business setting ultimately depends on the type of data you’ll be storing, the volume of data, among others. Each database has its strength and weaknesses. While conducting research, I found that a user willing to be hands on might consider working with Oracle 12c. With Oracle, you have to provide your own hardware, for example to allocate disk space used to create room for the segments. You also have control over whether the database is online or offline, determining when data files are available. Dynamo removes you from having to think about how to set up the infrastructure because the database’s ecosystem is handled by Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>Each database handles instance failure different as well, I found that Oracle automatically maintains processes to write every transaction synchronously to the redo log buffer so that data not yet written to data files can be retrieved. Dynamo was designed with the expectation that failures are going to occur, so the database is constantly anticipating these anomalies, as a result, data store mechanisms were made to also update regardless of server failure. In this sense, each database handles these basic but critical functions. So in a sense both databases are similar in that they have the capabilities to handle instance failure. </p>
<p>Another similarity to point out is that both databases are capable of scaling extremely fast in a short amount of time, though each accomplishes this in its own unique way. We know that data is stored in partitions in Dynamo, so when a large amount of data is stored partition settings dynamically increase. And for Oracle, an Automatic Segment Space Management (ASSM) is used in conjunction with bitmaps to manage space in tablespace. In a sense, ASSM functions similar to partition settings in that storage is able to be automatically fluctuate to accommodate incoming flows of data.</p>
<p>In conclusion, determining which database to use boils down to your business requirements and expectations of how data should be stored, modified or gathered. I would be remised if I did not end the discussion by mentioning one obvious distinction, which is that Oracle is a relational database management system and adheres to Structured Query Language. On the other hand, as we’ve touch on quite a bit is that Dynamo a NoSQL database relying on a provisioned throughput model to process data via documents, such as JSON and XML.</p></p>

  			<p>04 February 2016</p>
  			<p><p>Today Terah was dropped off at Dulles Airport to catch his flight heading to Orlando, Florida. As you know,<br/>Terah spent the holidays with us. It was a welcomed stay, both for us and for him. For us it was nice to have<br/>someone close to our family living in the US spending the holidays with us. For him, it must have been great to<br/>get away from everything, school, work and the pressure of getting his life back on track to come and spend<br/>time with us and see that there are other Ugandans in the US who have been through the road his embarking on.<br/>He has a ridiculously long road ahead of him. He has so many dreams and aspirations. I’m afraid his expectations<br/>are almost impossible given his circumstances today.</p>
<p>The US is not an easy place to make it, the country is embedded with so many obstacles designed to slow anyone down.<br/>From house expenses, car expenses, school loans etc. these are merely the few among the many roadblocks in place that<br/>he’ll learn to deal with. Obviously anyone with smarts, vision, dream, discipline, world class desire and work ethic<br/>can make it anywhere including US. My main concern is that he is following his passion for music, which is admirable<br/>but the music industry is notorious for its uncertainty in terms of striking it big, middle wages and low job outlook.<br/>To me this implies that after school he's going to go through a laborious period trying to locate an entry level job. </p>
<p>An attractive approach he could have taken would have been acquiring a hard skill or an in demand skill. This insures<br/>that he not only has an easy road to employment after school, but will command an above salary sooner. These skills will<br/>also be marketable in Uganda, the country he hopes to one day go back to and conduct his music aspirations. My hope is<br/>that he left Northern Virginia with inspiration and hope that he too can make it in the US like many people before him.<br/>I don’t think it has quite sank in the amount of work it is going to take to achieve his dreams. He needs to take each<br/>opportunity like it’s his last, not let his passion blind side him. </p>
<p>Passion can only take you so far, if a person doesn’t have the aptitude to make tough decisions, decisions that go against<br/>his or her beliefs and everything they have known their entire life (beliefs, ideologies, values etc), career (choosing<br/>another path/ making a one eighty) that person does not have what it takes to be great!! In his situation, Terah has to be a<br/>shark, ruthless and merciless, and last but not least have a world class work ethic!!</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2016/cnu-friends-at-buffalo-wings.html"><h1>CNU friends at Buffalo Winds</h1></a>
  			<p>17 January 2016</p>
  			<p><p>Today was a typical day in my shoes; mellow much of the day with a sharp up tick towards the evening.<br/>Nothing really exciting happened during the day just worked really hard at Gumax International making<br/>pies with Terah. The highlight of the day was having dinner with my CNU friends at Buffalo Wings<br/>Factory and shortly following that going bowling at Bowl America with my lovely and always wonderful<br/>girlfriend Mary.</p>
<p>Similar to great stories, I will start this conversation from the beginning so you can walk in my shoes on<br/>this particular day. Feeling ambiguous the night before, I set the alarm clock to 700am in order to have<br/>enough time to prepare and head out to Gumax International and be there around 800am (Its funny<br/>how the world works, you can start set you mind to something but then totally get complacent for one<br/>reason or the other). In reality, I managed to get out of bed around 735am sluggishly and painfully<br/>trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I’m running a bit late.</p>
<p>Terah and I finally arrived at Gumax International around 840am. Because today Terah was tagging<br/>along, instead of driving to the office as usual, we directly drove out to Guma’s house. The night before I<br/>spoke to Mr. Guma about today’s objectives and he insisted that we head to the house in the morning<br/>to work on the products and that we would be working with a Ugandan helper (embarrassingly I do not<br/>remember her name even after all these days working with her). At the house, Ugandan helper and<br/>Terah were well acquainted. They both had a lot in common largely because both of them had strong<br/>ties to Uganda. At this point, Terah has been living in the States for about 5 months making him very<br/>fresh and still remembers the economic, social and political affairs of Uganda. On the other token,<br/>Ugandan helper is roughly 70 years old (totally guessing so take the age for what its worth) and had<br/>lived in Uganda all of her life.</p>
<p>As hinted above, this turned out to be quite an enjoyable day for me listening to the different<br/>conversations that aroused during the course of the day. Topics span from Education and Jobs in Uganda<br/>to girls and how to staying away from crazy unpredictable girls in the US. From today I can honestly say<br/>that Terah is a genuine man, humble, goal orientated and smart caught at the wrong side of the life. His<br/>step in life took him in a corner of which he totally does not deserve. Life is not kind and it’s a shame. So<br/>there I will leave it at that. Let’s move on shall we.</p>
<p>Ok, this is ridiculous; don’t know if you will be reading this (Alex Makumbi) or someone else (Stranger)<br/>but whoever it is let me explain. Today is Jan 04 2016, and kid you not; Guma still has not paid me for<br/>November 2015 even after emailing him my hours. Here is my predicament, in less than a week, I have<br/>to pay a credit card bill of about $250, have to pay school fees soon of about $700 and need some spare<br/>money to take out my girl friend before she heads out to school and need to pay for gas. Stress levels<br/>are mounting at this point because his holding me hostage. I’ll surely discuss the situation with him<br/>tomorrow.</p>
<p>Work ended at around 400pm. We managed to make back home around 435pm leaving me with little<br/>time to get ready for my dinner with Steve Landry. A brief back story about Landry, we played soccer<br/>together at CNU and he consistently was there for me willing to get dinner with me and always willing to<br/>hang out with me. I hold him at high regards.</p>
<p>Arrived at our meeting point at Buffalo Wings Factory in Chantilly on time. Landry didn’t end up arriving<br/>unit about 20mins late. We all walked in the restaurant together. At the restaurant joining us was Chung<br/>Money (currently in grad school studying PT), and two other CNU buddies. Dinner was lovely; as always<br/>Steve was the center of it all with endless stories of what our classmates we knew were currently doing.<br/>Most was positive it seems everyone is working hard starting at the bottom in entry level jobs renting<br/>out apartments contemplating on what city to move to and whether to stay in a particular job for a<br/>certain period of time or not - basically doing what I am doing now. </p>
<p>Ending on a good note, Steve's birthday is Jan 26 2016. Very much would love to celebrate with<br/>him but knowing me I probably will not get the chance. After dinner I met up with Mary and took her<br/>Bowling. Probably the highlight of my night/day.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2016/roller-coaster-of-emotions.html"><h1>Roller-coaster of emotions</h1></a>
  			<p>10 January 2016</p>
  			<p><p>The only fitting description for today would be roller-coaster of emotions. The day began in unexpected<br/>fashion. I woke up bright and early at around 830 just in time for the Chelsea verse Cristal Palace.<br/>Embarking on a new day my mind was empty free of any outside problems, the only objective at the<br/>time was to brash my teeth, walk downstairs to the sitting room and connect my laptop to the television<br/>and live stream the game. Feeling a bit hungry walked into the kitchen finding mom cleaning the dishes.<br/>Politely greeted her and acquired on if she had good sleep. To my surprise, she was in a terrible mood<br/>(as though the whole night she had been playing with random thoughts, juggling trying to make out all<br/>of them at once only to foggy up her mind at a point when she cannot remember why she was feeling<br/>the way she was or why she was trying to understand).</p>
<p>She was clearly not happy with me because in her mind I was extremely rude and not helpful in the<br/>vehicle search the day before. It all began yesterday during the day. Around noon she forwarded on my<br/>email a list of about 6 – 7 vehicles she had found on craigslist. Obviously in a different state of mind I<br/>lethargically quickly glanced at the list of vehicles and found that the majority of vehicles were above<br/>our budget so I dismissed the whole list entirely since in reality to me it didn’t matter. And since<br/>Woodbridge Auto Action had our deposit of $300, I thought it would be in our best interest to look at<br/>vehicles there so we do not lose our money. After doing a quick search I came across 4 vehicles in great<br/>condition and in our budget so I showed her pictures along with there basic specs (mileage, condition<br/>etc.). To my surprise she loved the vehicles and even proposed that we head over to the dealership that<br/>evening since it was slow day and it would be nice get this car search over with before everyone gets<br/>busy.</p>
<p>At the dealership, after looking at several cars we landed on a 2010 Hyundai Sonata. The vehicle was in<br/>great condition partly because the car was only 5 years old. The engine was very quite which apparently<br/>implies the vehicle should be able to run for another 30,000 miles. With that said, the car had extremely<br/>high millage, 88,000 miles more than our cut off mileage conflicting with one of mom’s top conditions.<br/>Her conditions were that we stay away from cars that have more than 150k miles, stay away from two<br/>doors, stay away from cars not made in Asia and obviously stay away from poorly maintained cars<br/>including cars that smelled like cigarettes. We loved the car so much that we ended up placing a deposit<br/>of 3k and we also managed to transfer our initial deposit of $300 on the 2010 Hyundai Sonata.</p>
<p>As you can see I was extremely surprised to wake up in the morning to find mom in the kitchen very<br/>angry with me. Her reason was that I did not care about the list of vehicles she had sent me on the<br/>email. Yes, I felt sorry for not paying much attention to the list, but to my defense she sent me mixed<br/>signals. She shouldn’t have sent me cars priced above our budget. Including cars priced above the<br/>budget gave the notion that each car on the list was above the budge when in reality she had imbedded<br/>cars below the budget that she really wanted me to look at. I understand that I should have taken the<br/>email seriously, but with the same token she should take some of the responsibility. For one, if you want<br/>me to look at two cars, don’t send me 5 other cars priced above the budget. Two, you placed a deposit<br/>on the Hyundai knowingly that we would be short 1k, so you shouldn’t pin the blame on me because<br/>ultimately you had the final say in the matter and that you should have used good judgment.</p>
<p>Luckily I managed to catch the second half of the Chelsea game. Willian had an amazing game,<br/>absolutely brilliant constantly making things happen whenever he had the ball and scoring the second<br/>goal securing the win. Total score (3-0) Chelsea. Sadly that was the only highlight of my Sunday. My<br/>mind was clouded from my discussion with mom, I just couldn’t understand, my intentions were good,<br/>yes I was a bit lazy one point or another during the process but I didn’t think it was fair to pin the blame<br/>squarely on me. We did not make a mistake because we all agree the car is great, however she’s<br/>thinking on what ifs; what ifs meaning we could have gotten a cheaper car.</p>
<p>During the day I took time to surf the web for cheap apartments and garages that would take our vehicle<br/>for a good price. Made a call and briefly talked to Herbert to get advice on how to go about scrapping<br/>the car. He really didn’t give me information that I already didn’t know but it was nice talking to him it<br/>had been a while. Afterwards I sluggishly went upstairs and read a Time Magazine on Steve Jobs. I was<br/>there for the reminder of the day and didn’t come down until the sun was down.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2016/Optimistic-view-of-2016.html"><h1>The optimistic view of 2016</h1></a>
  			<p>04 January 2016</p>
  			<p><p>At this time each year I take a moment to reflect on the year that was. The year 2015 began with me<br/>knowing that I was embarking on the next phase in my life given that I had just graduated from college<br/>in December 2014. I had somewhat of an idea how the year would turn out; for example I had secured<br/>an internship with MenEngage so I knew I’ll be working in D.C but didn’t quite know how it would pan-<br/>out, I wasn’t totally jumping for joy about the opportunity simply glad that I wouldn’t be home searching<br/>for jobs. Also I knew that I would be visiting Africa for a period of time and that it would be the first time<br/>visiting the continent in roughly 13 years. My visit to Africa was what I looked forward to the most<br/>starting the year because I somehow knew it would change the course of my life (my thinking) and<br/>indeed my life was forever changed. This brought with it a lot of turbulence both mentally and<br/>professionally. The trip allowed me to rethink how I thought about careers, allowed me to look deep<br/>inside myself to determine truly what I wanted to do with my life - understanding what path in life<br/>would help me reach my burning desires. So as you can imagine, there was a lot uncertainty and<br/>confusion during this time. I beat myself up inside for not foreseeing and actually valuing my education before<br/>getting to this point, and I vow to never take life and opportunities for granted.</p>
<p>The New Year has approached in quick fashion brining with it an abundance of optimism. There is no<br/>doubt that 2016 is going to be special. Special in terms of not only will it be my second year in the real<br/>world, but this year I’ll consume more information that I have consumed last year and the year before.<br/>For starters, I’ll continue with course work at UMUC, in fact, in total I’ll be taking 7 courses in Software<br/>Development and Security. On top of that, during the summer I’ll aim to secure an internship to<br/>supplement my education and gain real work experience and make connections in the software field.</p>
<p>Secondly, in 2016, I’ll continue assisting Mr. Augustine Guma with is Start-Up Gumax International. This<br/>year Gumax International is expended to open a brand new restaurant in Woodbridge called Gumax<br/>Spicy Pies which is projected to generate a lot of revenue for the company. Before 2015 ended<br/>customers were placing in orders for the products so all these positive signs imply that the restaurant<br/>will be welcomingly busy. Another thing to look forward to is that Gumax International was picked as<br/>one of the vendors at the Super Bowl in San Francisco this coming February. I hope Guma picks me to<br/>attend such a massive event. Lastly, I’ll experience first hand how it’s like to work as a staff accountant<br/>during tax season. During this period my accountancy skills will truly be enhance expanding my brain<br/>farther.</p>
<p>I cannot write a first blog without mentioning the people in my life that make my life happen and<br/>enjoyable. There is one thing that I’ve learned in this world no one no matter how successful someone is<br/>no one goes through life by themselves. Each year as life happens people enter and leave your life -<br/>some enhance your life making you a better person emotionally, professionally or economically, and<br/>some enter your life to only pull you back. On August 16 th 2015, I was able to have the girl of my dreams<br/>enter my life. She not only makes my heart sing sounds of joy each time I see her, but she stimulates my<br/>brain and my thinking each time we talk. I look forward sharing my journey with her this year. My family<br/>also plays a massive role; they are always supportive, always patent with me and are always looking out<br/>for my best interest even when I cannot see it at the time. I love all of them and cannot wait to make<br/>them proud some day.</p></p>
